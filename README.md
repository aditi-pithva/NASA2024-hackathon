# Gender Inequality and Climate Change: A Data Analysis

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook conducts a detailed analysis to explore the relationship between gender inequality and various factors related to climate change and development. By leveraging open-source data, the goal is to uncover patterns that highlight how gender inequality correlates with climate change and development indices across different regions.

## Key Objectives
* Regression Analysis: Analyze how human development indices (HDI) and gender development indices (GDI) are related across regions.
* Impact of Development on Gender Equality: Investigate how development levels impact gender equality in various countries.
* Regional Variations: Highlight specific insights for regions like South Asia, which shows considerable variability in development and gender equality.
* Propose Solutions: The notebook suggests data-driven solutions that could simultaneously promote gender equality and climate action.

## Data Sources
The analysis uses open-source data on:
* Gender Development Indices (GDI)
* Human Development Indices (HDI)
* Climate Change Metrics

## Methodology
* Regression Analysis: A regression model is built to identify the relationship between development indices and gender equality.
* Regional Comparison: The notebook includes a regional breakdown of development and gender inequality, focusing on specific regions like South Asia and Latin America.
* Visualization: The data is visualized using plots to better understand the correlation between various factors.

## Insights
* Higher Development Leads to Better Gender Equality: Countries with higher HDI almost always exhibit higher GDI, suggesting that investing in education, healthcare, and the economy fosters gender equality.
* Variations in Less Developed Countries: In countries with lower development levels, the relationship between HDI and GDI is less consistent, indicating that cultural and policy-related factors play a significant role in gender equality.

## Tools and Libraries
This notebook was developed using the following libraries:
* Pandas for data manipulation.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
* Scikit-learn for regression modeling.

## Conclusion
This analysis highlights the strong correlation between gender development and human development, emphasizing that targeted policies for improving education, healthcare, and economic opportunities can promote both gender equality and climate action.
